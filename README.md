## basic installation for all <a name = "install-all"></a>

Required packages for Ubuntu:
```zsh
sudo apt install apache2 python3 python3-pip postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Install virtualenv and django:
```zsh
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv ihr
```

Install django:
```zsh
cd ihr
. bin/activate
pip install django
```

Create a new django project:
```zsh
django-admin startproject internetHealthReport
```

Copy IHR's django application :
```zsh
cd internetHealthReport
git clone git@github.com:InternetHealthReport/ihr-django.git ihr

```

Then copy settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, Dockerfile,docker compose to the correct place:
```zsh
cp ihr/config/*.py internetHealthReport/
cp ihr/config/Dockerfile .
cp ihr/config/docker-compose.yml .
```
You may have to adjust some variables in settings.py to match your database, smtp account, recapcha credentials.

## If you wish to use your machine <a name = "machine"></a>

install dependencies
```zsh
pip install -r ihr/requirements.txt
```

make sure that the host of database in the settings is localhost
    
```zsh
    cd internetHealthReport
    nano settings.py
```
scroll down to the DATABASES section and make sure that the host is localhost
    

Create the database and django user (change password as needed):
```zsh
sudo su postgres
psql
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE ihr;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# CREATE USER django WITH PASSWORD '123password456';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# ALTER ROLE django SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# ALTER ROLE django SET timezone TO 'UTC';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ihr TO django;
GRANT
postgres=#\q
exit
```

Remove migration files and create tables: (TODO move production migration files to a different repository)
```zsh
find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc"  -delete
./manage.py makemigrations
manage.py migrate
```

Start django:
```zsh
./manage.py runserver
```

## if you want to use docker <a name = "docker"></a>


install docker

```zsh
sudo apt install docker
```


make sure that the host of database in the settings is db
    
```zsh
    cd internetHealthReport
    nano settings.py
```
scroll down to the DATABASES section and make sure that the host is db
    


make sure you are in the internetHealthReport directory

## if you want to use docker with local postgres <a name = "docker-local"></a>

Get your local ip address

```zsh
hostname -I
```
you will get something like that

```zsh
xxx.xxx.x.xx
```
copy the first IP address and paste it in the docker compose file in extra hosts section

```zsh
    extra_hosts:
      - "database:xxx.xxx.x.xx"
```

allow your postgres to accept connections from outside

```zsh
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/**/main/postgresql.conf
```

change the following line

```zsh
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'
```

to

```zsh
listen_addresses = '*'
```

allow your postgres to accept connections from outside

```zsh
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/**/main/pg_hba.conf
```

add the following line

```zsh
host    all             all            172.xx.0.00/16            md5
```
xx may vary depending on postgres version but in newer versions it is 20 else it could be 17


start the docker container

```zsh
docker compose up
```
and of course you need to have a postgres database running on your machine 

## if you want to use docker with remote postgres <a name = "docker-remote"></a>

uncomment the postgres image and volume database in docker compose

```zsh
    #   db:
    #     image: kartoza/postgis:9.6-2.4
    #     volumes:
    #       - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    #     environment:
    #       - POSTGRES_USER=django
    #       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123password456
    #       - POSTGRES_DB=ihr

    # volumes:
    #   postgres_data:
```

make sure in settings in DATABASES the host is db not database

and then start the container 
    
```zsh
    docker compose up
```


If this is the first time to run the container, you need to apply the migration files

```zsh
docker ps
```

you will find something like that 
    
```zsh
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
    1c1c1c1c1c1c   internethealthreport-django-app         "python manage.py ru‚Ä¶"       20 seconds ago   Up 19 seconds
```

copy the container id and run the following command

```zsh
docker exec -it 1c1c1c1c1c1c /bin/bash
```

you will be inside the container

```zsh
python manage.py migrate
```

congratulations, you have a running django server

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/hegemony/ to check if it is working.


## Celery components <a name = "celery"></a>

    You can find celery in many files including 
    - _init_.py in internethealthreport directory
    - celery.py
    - tasks.py
    - settings.py

    Celery Beat is used as a scheduler for Celery to do the task in a fixed interval of time.

    In the __init__.py file, it just tells the apps that there is a Celery app to link with them.

    In the celery.py file, it just integrates Celery with the app, and compine their settings, and discovers the tasks that it will be linked with.

    The celery performs the appropriate tasks in tasks.py.

    In settings.py, line 260+, it sets the zone of the celery and tells him which task will be scheduled and its interval.


### If you want to add a new task to celery

    If it is new task 
        - You can add the task in tasks.py
    
    If it is the same task but for different topic 
        - You can copy the task and just change the topic that is found in the TopicPartition function

    Note that 
        - tasks.py is exists in internethealthreport folder
        - Don't forget to write ```@shared_task()``` on top of the function

    - import this function in celery.py file the same way as the kafka_alert imported

    - in settings.py, scroll down to the last thing and you will find CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE and add this function to it the same way as kafka_alert is added (please note that you have to give it the same name as the function name)

## Add test data to the database <a name = "add-test-data"></a>
In the production database some of the ids are changed to BIGINT. We should
locally apply these changes before importing data:
```zsh
psql -U django -d ihr -c "ALTER TABLE ihr_hegemony ALTER COLUMN id SET DATA TYPE bigint"
psql -U django -d ihr -c "ALTER TABLE ihr_hegemony_prefix ALTER COLUMN id SET DATA TYPE bigint"
psql -U django -d ihr -c "ALTER TABLE ihr_hegemony_country ALTER COLUMN id SET DATA TYPE bigint"
psql -U django -d ihr -c "ALTER TABLE ihr_atlas_delay ALTER COLUMN id SET DATA TYPE bigint"
```

Download a database snapshot and load it:
```zsh
wget https://ihr-archive.iijlab.net/ihr-dev/psql-snapshot/2022-03-10/2022-03-10_psql_snapshot.sql.lz4 
lz4 2022-03-10_psql_snapshot.sql.lz4 
psql -U django ihr < 2022-03-10_psql_snapshot.sql
```

## Running the application
Activate the python environment and lunch django server:
```zsh
cd ihr 
. bin/activate
internetHealthReport/manage.py runserver
```
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/hegemony/ to check if it is working.

## Working with a local instance of IHR website (https://github.com/InternetHealthReport/ihr-website)
To redirect all API calls to the local django server you should change the API
URL in ihr-website/src/plugins/IhrApi.js:
```js
const IHR_API_BASE = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'
```
